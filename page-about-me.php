                    <p class="roboto-r color-gray font-16">After graduating from Loyola Marymount University, my primary goal was not to find a job, but to be an “investor.” I read a book called Rich Dad Poor Dad that really changed my thoughts on how I view money and life. After about 10 years of “investing” I had little direction, no advice or guidance as to what I wanted to accomplish.

                        <br>
                        After doing odd jobs, I landed a position at Brown Van Remmen Kanuit. My original job description was a database project converting one database to another database. The project was to last about 1 or 2 years. Brown Van Remmen Kanuit was an Executive Search Firm, specializing in marketing and advertising. As I attended meetings with other recruiters, I gave suggestions on potential candidates based on my knowledge of the firm’s database. My role transitioned into a researcher which eventually transitioned into become a full fledge Executive Recruiter.

                        <br>
                        I was very fortunate in being mentored by seasoned, professional recruiters. I learned how to evaluate resumes, personalities and opportunities. Recruiting has allowed me to bridge my personal talent of explaining things in easy, simple manners.

                        Currently, I am an Executive Recruiter at a major automotive manufacturer. I work on a wide variety of positions ranging from administrative assistants to national marketing directors.
